Note: if you are doing a pre-release rather than an official release, please skip this step and go to the [next step](/dev/release_process/post_release/). 

The manifest api shows a hash of all files in a release. 

Its original purpose as to allow for doing diffs/security checks between a customized zen-cart and the original files.

On the Server Manager dashboard:
