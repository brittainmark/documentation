Note: if you are doing a pre-release rather than an official release, please skip this step and go to the [next step](/dev/release_process/release_links/). 

The Server Manager controls the endpoint that allows for a call home from within Zen Cart admin.  (It was formerly called the Ping Server, or `ping.zen-cart.com`.) 

It will notify a shop owner if a new release is available.

On the Server Manager site dashboard, access the `Version Manager > Versions` menu.

Create a new release by clicking the "New Version" button.
