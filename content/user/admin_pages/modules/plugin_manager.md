The Plugin Manager page provides a single place to install and uninstall plugins created in accordance with the new [encapsulated plugin architecture](/dev/plugins/encapsulated_plugins/) introduced in 1.5.7. 

It is accessed using Admin > Modules > Plugin Manager.

The base install of Zen Cart contains the Display Logs plugin, both as an example and as a useful feature.  Other encapsulated plugins are available in the [plugin library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php). 

Other notable plugins that have been converted to use encapsulation are:

- [Sales Report](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=9)
- [Clone a Template](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2087)
- [Mod List](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2039) 

Developers seeking more information about this topic should read [the dev documents on encapsulation](/dev/plugins/encapsulated_plugins/).

Starting in version 2.2.0, the plugin manager shows modules grouped by status and sort order.

Prior to version 2.2.0, the plugin manager sorted modules alphabetically.
