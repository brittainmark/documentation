Zen Cart has the following mechanisms for detecting and blocking fraudulent activity: 

- The [orders](/user/admin_pages/customers/orders/) screen has an indication at the left that the billing and shipping addresses are different.  This can in some cases be a clue that the order is fraudulent. 
- In Zen Cart 1.5.8 and above, the IP address used for account creation is tracked and displayed on the [Admin > Customers > Customers](/user/admin_pages/customers/customers/#customer-infobox) page in the right hand infobox when a customer is selected. 
- In Zen Cart 2.2.0 and above, the feature [Customer account activation](/user/orders/customer_approval/#customer-account-activation) may be used to ensure that customers are using valid email addresses they own for account creation.
