This help file describes newer "encapsulated" plugins that are installed under `zc_plugins`.  For older plugines which are copied directly into the `includes` and `admin` folders, see [How to uninstall a plugin](/user/plugins/how_to_uninstall_a_plugin).

Encapsulated plugins have been supported in Zen Cart since version 1.5.7, as a way to make plugin installation and maintenance easier for end users.  Developers may learn more by reading [the encapsulated plugin documentation](/dev/plugins/encapsulated_plugins).

Encapsulated plugins are controlled using the [Plugin Manager](/user/admin_pages/modules/plugin_manager).

By design, uninstalling an encapsulated plugin is very simple.  Go to Admin > Modules > Plugin Manager, select the plugin you want to uninstall, and press the Uninstall button.  You will need to confirm the action, but the process is entirely controlled through your admin panel; no manual actions are required.
