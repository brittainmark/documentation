Users who have accounts in your store have access to a page called My Account.
This page is a jumping-off point to pages that show the orders, addresses and other account information for the current logged in user.

Clicking the "View" button shows the associated order.

Clicking the "View or change my account information" link allows you to update your name, email address, telephone and fax number and whether you wish to receive TEXT or HTML email.

Note that changing the email address on Zen Cart sites with [account activation](/user/orders/customer_approval/#customer-account-activation) will  trigger
the sending of a validation email, and the customer may not checkout until they
click the link in this email.
