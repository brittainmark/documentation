The product info page in Zen Cart is the page that focuses on an individual product.  For products with attributes, it is the only page that allows the product to be added to the cart (since attribute settings need to be made before that is done). 

Here's a screenshot of the product info page using the Responsive Classic Redesigned template:

The fields whihc are displayed on this page may be configured using the [Admin > Configuration > Product Info page](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productinfo/) and the 
[Admin > Catalog > Product Types > Edit Layout Settings](/user/admin_pages/catalog/product_types_edit_layout/) page.
