In earlier versions of Zen Cart, additional images for a product were required to use the [filename matching mechanism](/user/images/image_filename_conventions/).

In Zen Cart 2.2.0, a new mechanism for specifying additional images was introduced.  The Configuration setting [Additional Images Handling](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_images/#additional_images_handling) allows you to specify additional images in database fields, rather than relying on the older [filename matching mechanism](/user/images/image_filename_conventions/).

FIXME TBD
