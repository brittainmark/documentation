There are slideshow plugins if you wish to show a rotating gallery of images on your home page.  The recommended one is 

- [ZX Slideshow](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1404) 

Generally slideshows make use of [Banner Manager](/user/admin_pages/tools/banner_manager) to load and organize images.  See the documentation provided by each plugin for details. 

Note that the [Bootstrap](/user/template/bootstrap/) template has a built-in slideshow. See the [Slider documentation](https://github.com/lat9/ZCA-Bootstrap-Template/wiki/Using-the-Home%E2%80%90Page-Slider-Feature) in the template wiki.
